## Starting & Stopping

We need SatReceiver to always start when the Raspberry Pi boots...

Copy `SatReceiver.service` to `/etc/systemd/system/` and enable, or just reboot.

```
sudo cp /home/pirec/SatReceiver/Resources/SatReceiver.service /etc/systemd/system/SatReceiver.service
sudo chmod 644 /etc/systemd/system/SatReceiver.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable SatReceiver
sudo systemctl start SatReceiver
```

To stop SatReceiver

`sudo systemctl stop SatReceiver`

To start SatReceiver

`sudo systemctl start SatReceiver`

To check the status of SatReceiver

`sudo systemctl status SatReceiver`

To disable SatReceiver on every reboot

`sudo systemctl disable SatReceiver`

To enable SatReceiver on every reboot

`sudo systemctl enable SatReceiver`

For more information `man systemctl`

To edit (if needed)

```
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/SatReceiver.service
```

We also need to have longmynd start and stop

```
cd
cp cp ~/SatReceiver/Resources/startLongmynd.sh ~/
chmod +x startLongmynd.sh
